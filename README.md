# ChooseElectric Bot

ChooseElectric is a Telegram bot designed to help users decide if switching to an electric vehicle is a viable option for them. Based on the information provided by the user, the bot utilizes the OpenAI API to analyze data about the user's current car model, monthly consumption, and other relevant factors to suggest electric alternatives. It also calculates potential savings in costs and emissions. The bot uses a fine-tuned language model to enable natural conversations and provide personalized recommendations.

The bot can be found on Telegram using the username: [@whyAnElectricCarBot](https://t.me/whyAnElectricCarBot).

Additionally, data analysis with the pandas library was used to evaluate the fine-tuning training process of the language model. This helped ensure the model's accuracy and reliability when interacting with users.

## Advantages of Fine-Tuning

Fine-tuning allows the model to be customized for specific use cases, improving its accuracy and relevance in particular domains. In this project, fine-tuning provided the following benefits:

- **Improved Contextual Understanding**: The model was trained on datasets specific to electric vehicles, enabling it to provide precise recommendations.
- **Enhanced Performance**: Fine-tuning reduced irrelevant or generic responses, ensuring a better user experience.
- **Cost Efficiency**: By fine-tuning a pre-trained model, the need for extensive data and computational resources was minimized compared to training a model from scratch.
- **Domain Expertise**: The bot delivers answers tailored to the context of electric vehicles, making it more reliable and useful.

## Example Conversation

**User**: I currently drive a Toyota Corolla 2018 and I commute 500km per month. Should I switch to an electric vehicle?

**Bot**: The Toyota Corolla 2018 has an average fuel consumption of 6 liters per 100 km. For your monthly commute of 500 km, you would spend approximately 30 liters of gasoline. At an average fuel cost of €1.8 per liter, this translates to €54 per month.

As an alternative, you could consider the Nissan Leaf, an all-electric vehicle. It consumes about 15 kWh per 100 km. For your monthly commute of 500 km, you would consume approximately 75 kWh of electricity. With an average electricity cost of €0.3 per kWh, this amounts to €22.50 per month.

Switching to an electric vehicle could save you €31.50 per month or €378 annually, while also contributing to a cleaner environment.
